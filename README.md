=================================
This project creates an overlay with two translucent white vertical bars to cover green vertical lines on the screen,
and a Stop button to remove the overlay.

How to build:

2. Choose 'Open' and select the `overlay_app` folder extracted from this ZIP.
3. Let Gradle sync. Then Run -> Build APK(s) or Run on device.
